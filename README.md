# Goal

On internet exists many tutorials and skeletons for creating frontend react application
and even more for creating backend server application. But there is almost nothing
about connecting it in working APP.

That's goal of this project.

Showing how you can create working react web page based on Next.js with server API connection.

## Solved problems

- Server Side Rendering
- Separated WEB and API router
- Styled components rendered on server and append to head element of page
- LESS file append before styled component in head element of page
- Passing config constant from server to client
- Passing data from router do layout
